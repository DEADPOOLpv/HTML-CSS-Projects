<a name="#C"><p><h3>C++</h3></p>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. 
It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, 
it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.
C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, 
the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes."
 However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p></a>

<a name="#PY"><p><h3>Python</h3></p>
<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures,
combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or 
glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library 
are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms,and can be freely distributed.</p></a>
